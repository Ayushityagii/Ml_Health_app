The Disease Prediction System is a web application built with Streamlit that predicts the likelihood of three diseases: Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease using machine learning models. The application provides an intuitive interface for users to input relevant health metrics and receive predictions based on their data.

Features
- **Multiple Disease Predictions**: Predicts Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-navigate web application with input forms for each disease.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant feedback on health predictions based on user inputs.

Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for developing the machine learning models and the web application.
- **Streamlit**: A framework for building interactive web applications in Python.
- **Pickle**: A Python library for serializing and deserializing Python object structures, used to load trained models.
- **Streamlit Option Menu**: A component to create a sidebar menu for navigating between different prediction pages.
